# Anorexia-Cost-Effectiveness

Anorexia School Programs-This is a Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of school-based Anorexia screening programs. 

<p></p>Eating disorders (ED) are comprised of anorexia, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder, which affects 16.3% of 9th-12th graders in the United States (Wright et al., 2014). The implication of no treatment from ED is reduced quality of life. According to Wright et al., the annual impact from ED in Australia and England range from $1.8 billion to $19.2 billion (USD). The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that school-based screening could decrease the health burden of ED. There are no studies that evaluated the health or economic impact of school-based ED screening programs. The Wright et al. study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of school-based ED screening by decision-analytics simulation models. The Drummond checklist for economic evaluation was the basis of the evaluation of the Wright et al. study, which was subdivided by structure, data, and consistency.

<b>Analysis 1: Accounting vs. Economic Costs</b> 
<p></p>This summarizes the annual costs, total undiscounted costs, and total discounted costs to initiate anorexia screening among middle and high school students. In economics, discounting is the process of determining the present-day value of future costs. In this intervention present day is considered 2017 and from 2018-2021 discounting will occur. The program is a cohort of 100,000 students that are screened for five years from 2017-2021. The cost for the five-year program includes training, implementation, monitoring, and App development/implementation. In excel, the columns K-O are the undiscounted costs per year of the anorexia screening. Column P shows undiscounted totals, and column Q shows discounted totals. 
<p></p>	Training has three activities: one-day training of district-level coordinators, training of teachers on school-based screening program led by district coordinator, and training of school health professionals. The one-day training is a start-up cost and is not discounted. The rest of the activities are annual costs that will be discounted after 2017 until 2021. 
<p></p>	Implementation has four activities: availability of SCOFF Screening Tool, implementation of SCOFF screening material, referral to health professional by a school health professional, and follow-up appointment by health professionals. These implementation activities are annual costs that will be discounted after 2017 until 2021. 
<p></p>	Monitoring has two activities: set up of monitoring protocol and ongoing monitoring from coordinators. The monitoring start-up is not discounted. The ongoing monitoring activities are annual costs that will be discounted after 2017 until 2021. 
<p></p>	App Development and Monitoring has two activities: set-up of App development with interdisciplinary App team and ongoing monitoring by state-level coordinators, district level coordinators, and IT team to ensure the quality of the App. The App team will include Clinical Psychologists, Nutritionists, Project Managers, Software Developers, and Software Designers. App development valuation of $250,000 is based on the quoted service contract that was verified by average App development fees. The App will be confirmatory of the SCOFF results by calculating the probability of anorexia. Monitoring valuation is based on Secretary of Health per diem and local salary scale. Monitoring quantity is based on the assumption of similar App development hours of work. The start-up of App development/Implementation is not discounted. The ongoing App monitoring activities are annual costs that will be discounted after 2017 until 2021. 
<p></p>	In the five-year anorexia screening program, annual costs were discounted by 3%, which is the standard rate for public health cost evaluations. Table 1 (See Below) shows undiscounted, discounted totals, and percentages of discounted totals of activities from 2017-2021. The total undiscounted cost of the anorexia screening is $10,622,110. The total discounted cost of the anorexia screening is $10,054,284. The distribution of discounted cost per activity is 10.0% for training, 30.3% for implementation, 27.8% for monitoring, and 31.8% for App development/implementation. Table 2 (See Below) shows the undiscounted and discounted cost per screened student. The undiscounted cost per screened student is $106.22. The discounted cost per screened student is $100.54.

<b>Analysis 2: Decision Tree </B>
<p></p>
The anorexia screening used a decision tree that was divided into screened versus not screened, then early treatment versus did not receive early treatment, and then developed severe anorexia versus did not develop severe anorexia. There were fifteen pathways with probabilities, costs, and effects associated. Limitations of decision trees are the events are assumed to be instantaneous, chronic illnesses have numerous outcomes and probabilities, and inability to account for real-world scenarios. The limitation of this secondary intervention was that the students were screened regardless of disease progression. SCOFF Sensitivity testing was used to confirm a “true positive” with anorexia nervosa diagnosis. SCOFF Specificity testing was used to confirm a “true negative” without anorexia nervosa diagnosis. Diagnostic follow-up cost occurred following a screen positive. Screened cost occurred in screened. Early treatment cost occurred in early treatment. Severe treatment costs incurred when students developed severe anorexia nervosa. Another limitation of the decision tree is that some students screened as true negative or false positive could develop anorexia nervosa over the 10-year intervention, and that it is unable to capture the progression of anorexia nervosa overtime.
<p></p>The results from the decision tree were net cost of $1676.40, the net QALYs gained was 0.0108756, and ICER of $154,143.22 per QALY. The screened intervention pathways are more expensive and more effective than not screened, which is potentially acceptable. The average CE threshold ratio from the CDC is $50,000-$100,000 per QALY; therefore, the screened intervention is not cost-effective. 

<p></p>
<b>Analysis 3: Markov Model</b>
<p></p>
The Anorexia Health Screening evaluated the cost-effectiveness of case screening versus no case screening. The limitation of the Markov Model is the independent probabilities between each transition state can only make predictions about the future solely on the present state. In the Anorexia Health Screening, the limitation is participants can transition into different states over the course of the intervention, and Markov Model has difficulty monitoring participants’ progression. Anorexia is a complex disease, where individuals can transition from healthy to severe to healthy within a 10 year period. The control discounted cost was $5440.37 (1-10 years), and the intervention discounted cost was $4047.21 (1-10 years). Through Markov Model analysis, the intervention was cost-effective. The recommendation for modeling is to use Microsimulation Models, which uses mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive health states. Each individual can be in one health state at any given cycle with specific transition probabilities and transitions depends on the individual’s past transitions and characteristics.
